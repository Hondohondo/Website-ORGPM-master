                            ORG Holdings Limited was formed in 1999 by Jonathan Berns and Edward Schwartz as a successor company to Berns Properties, Inc, a real estate development, investment and consulting company Mr. Berns founded in 1984.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since 1984, ORG Holdings has accumulated a diverse portfolio of thirteen separate investment properties located in Northeast Ohio.
                            This activity is funded with capital from ORG Holdings’ principals and third party non-institutional investors.
                            Through its successful development, ownership, operation and management of this diverse portfolio, ORG Holdings’ principals have gained considerable skills and hands-on real estate experience which provides an added dimension to the advice provided to clients.
                            Day-to-day property management for the portfolio is provided by professional third party property management firms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From 1994 to 1999, immediately prior to joining Mr. Berns, Mr. Schwartz was a senior consultant with The Townsend Group, a Cleveland based institutional real estate consultant.
                            In 2001, upon expiration of Mr. Schwartz’s non-compete agreement with his prior employer, ORG Holdings commenced providing real estate investment advice on a retainer basis to institutional investors.
                            ORG Holdings became a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC in 2004.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2005, ORG Holdings expanded to form ORG Portfolio Management LLC as a privately held Registered Investment Adviser focusing on portfolio management and institutional real estate consulting.
